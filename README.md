# Downloads Manager

This program used to automatically organize user Downloads folder in good manner.

# Example:

If we move a file to Downloads directory, first analyse the file and determine the type of file. Then if the file is image type then its moved to Image folder, or the file is video type then its moved to Videos folder.

# Folder categories

    Images  Videos  Audios  Documents   Others

Development is not complete. You have to change the folder_to_track value to your Downloads directory.
