# Downloads Manager

This program used to automatically organize user Downloads folder in good manner.

# Example:

If we move a file to Downloads directory, first analyse the file and determine the type of file. Then if the file is image type then its moved to Image folder, or the file is video type then its moved to Videos folder.

# Folder categories
